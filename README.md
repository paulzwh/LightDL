# LightDL
Light (but comprehensive as possible) training code templates for deep learning.

It is expected that you can easily and intuitively modify and debug on these templates!

### In Process:

+ Pytorch ([1.13](./pytorch-1.13/))
+ MONAI ([1.3](./monai-1.3/))
+ Paddle ([2.6](./paddle-2.6/))

### Planning:

+ [Ignite](https://pytorch-ignite.ai/)
+ [MONAI](https://docs.monai.io/) (on Ignite)
